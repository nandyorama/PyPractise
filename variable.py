#The Python approach is simple, it doesnâ€™t require a static keyword. All variables which are assigned a value in class declaration are class variables. And variables which are assigned values inside class methods are instance variables.

# Python program to show that the variables with a value 
# assigned in class declaration, are class variables
 
# Class for Computer Science Student
class CSStudent:
    stream = 'cse'                  # Class Variable
    def __init__(self,name,roll):
        self.name = name            # Instance Variable
        self.roll = roll            # Instance Variable
 
# Objects of CSStudent class
a = CSStudent('Geek', 1)
b = CSStudent('Nerd', 2)
 
print(a.stream)  # prints "cse"
print(b.stream)  # prints "cse"
print(a.name)    # prints "Geek"
print(b.name)    # prints "Nerd"
print(a.roll)    # prints "1"
print(b.roll)    # prints "2"
 
# Class variables can be accessed using class
# name also
print(CSStudent.stream) # prints "cse"
